# This is a sample DMX instrument config file -- in fact, the one used for the
# We, Montana! Great Room.


# Note, this is by no means meant to be an optimal setup -- it is rather a de
# facto description; a holdover from when our lights were contolled from a slider
# board.

# The side in the name of a lighting instrument is which side it shines on (or
# which side it shines better on, in the case of dynamic spotlights), not which
# side the actual instrument is on.
